## **Introduction**

Ransomware is one of the most significant cybersecurity threats today, causing substantial financial and operational damages. By analyzing historical ransomware attacks, this project aims to uncover trends and patterns in ransomware campaigns, enabling organizations to proactively safeguard their systems.

---

## **Dataset**

### Sources
The dataset consists of:
1. **Ransomware Attack Logs**:
   - Date of attacks.
   - Ransomware family names (e.g., WannaCry, REvil).
   - Attack vectors used (e.g., phishing, RDP exploits).
2. **Victim Profiles**:
   - Industries affected.
   - Geographical regions.
3. **Ransom Demands**:
   - Payment amounts.
   - Cryptocurrency types used.
4. **Outcome Data**:
   - Systems recovered.
   - Payment status (paid/not paid).

### Structure
The dataset includes:
- **Attack Characteristics**: TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- **Temporal Patterns**: Attack frequency over time.
- **Technical Indicators**: File hashes, encryption methods, and IoCs (Indicators of Compromise).

---

## **Features Extracted**

The following features were extracted for analysis:
- **Temporal Features**: Month, year, and seasonal trends in ransomware activity.
- **Attack Vector Analysis**: Most commonly exploited vulnerabilities.
- **Economic Impact**: Average and total ransom demands by region and industry.
- **Ransomware Evolution**: Family relationships and variants.
- **Cryptocurrency Trends**: Usage and transaction patterns in ransom payments.

## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Standardized columns across multiple data sources.
- Cleaned inconsistent and missing data.
- Normalized numerical features for modeling.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified trends in ransomware attacks.
- Visualized attack vectors and economic impacts using interactive charts.
- Mapped geographical distributions of ransomware campaigns.

### **3. Modeling**
- Developed predictive models for:
  - **Attack Detection**: Identifying potential ransomware based on IoCs.
  - **Trend Forecasting**: Predicting future attack patterns using historical data.
- Tested multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time-series forecasting.

### **4. Mitigation Insights**
- Analyzed patterns in attack success vs. failure.
- Identified best practices for ransomware prevention.

## **Modeling and Analysis**

### **Techniques Used**
1. **Classification Models**:
   - Predict ransomware family based on attack characteristics.
2. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   - ARIMA and LSTM for trend prediction.
3. **Clustering**:
   - K-Means to group ransomware families by behavior.
4. **Graph Analysis**:
   - Used graph-based techniques to explore relationships between ransomware families and IoCs.

---

## **Results**

1. **Key Findings**:
   - Seasonal spikes in ransomware activity, particularly in Q4.
   - Phishing emails remain the most common attack vector.
   - Healthcare and finance industries are the most targeted.
   - Cryptocurrency payments increasingly favor privacy coins over Bitcoin.

2. **Model Performance**:
   - Attack detection model: **94% accuracy**.
   - Trend forecasting (LSTM): **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of 5% on future attack predictions.
